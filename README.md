# FrontEnd Guitar Shop Course Project

This project is part of a Vue 3 course where I revisited and practiced fundamental concepts of Vue.js. The purpose of this project is to solidify my understanding of core features in Vue 3, including `ref`, `reactive`, `watch`, `computed`, `emit`, and `props`.

## Key Features

- **`ref` and `reactive`**: Learned how to declare reactive variables and objects to manage state effectively.
- **`watch`**: Used watchers to observe and respond to changes in reactive data.
- **`computed`**: Created computed properties for derived state that automatically updates based on dependencies.
- **`emit`**: Implemented communication from child components to parent components using custom events.
- **`props`**: Passed data from parent components to child components to ensure proper component communication.

## Project Goals

1. **Practice Vue 3 fundamentals**: Gain hands-on experience with core concepts.
2. **Build reusable components**: Create components that demonstrate effective use of props, events, and reactive data.
3. **Understand the reactivity system**: Dive deep into how Vue's reactivity system works using `ref` and `reactive`.
